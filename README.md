# Hi there, I'm Pablo! 👋

I am an MSc Student in Biomedical Engineering at ETH Zurich 🇨🇭 fully funded by ['la Caixa' Foundation](https://becarios.fundacionlacaixa.org/es/pablo-blasco-fernandez-B005814), currently exploring the fascinating world of deep learning, medical image analysis and computer vision. I hold a BSc in Biomedical Engineering from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid 🇪🇸, where my passion for this field first began.

## 🧬My experience

- 🏥 Graduate researcher at the **Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging**, affiliated to **Harvard University** and **Massachusetts General Hospital**, working in 3D to 2D projections for brain surface segmentation (Python, Pytorch Lightning).

- 👁️‍🗨️ Graduate researcher at the **Computer Vision Lab of ETH Zurich**, contributing to cutting-edge research at the intersection of computer vision and deep learning trough the use of training-free neural networks (Python, Pytorch, Pandas, OpenCV).

- ❤️ Undergraduate Researcher at the **Spanish National Center for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC)**, finding associations between cardiovascular risk factors and cerebral blood flow trough MRI image processing (MATLAB, SPM) and statistical analysis (SPM, R).

## 🌱 Current Interests

- 💻 Machine learning and AI in healthcare
- 📊 Data analysis and visualization in biomedical research
- 🏥 Medical imaging and diagnostics

I'm passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on healthcare, and I'm always eager to learn and collaborate on exciting projects.
